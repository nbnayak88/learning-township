## Demo 08 of the BTM11 Financials Ultimate Bootcamp demo series

**SuccessLabs Academy · BTM11 · Financials (FIN) · Ultimate (Level 5) · Bootcamp**
**Version:** 2026-11-10 · Demonstration material; not an enrolled course, certification or published pathway.

> **Evidence boundary:** OmniCapital Financial Group is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources describe security perspectives; the agent permissions, threats and checks below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `FIN-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Security architecture for AI and autonomous operations: what can an assistant or agent do, as whom, and what stops it doing more?*

**What this file shows:** an identity and permission model for OmniCapital's assistant and agents, four threat scenarios with a control and a check, and the sector boundary that no agent may cross.

**What it does not show:** a configured identity tenant, a penetration test result or a certified control.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 46B financial group; USD 1.4T AUM; 58M customers; 32 countries |
| Business mix | Retail 31%; commercial 24%; wealth 19%; insurance 16%; payments and markets 10% |
| Source problem | Fragmented customer, product, risk and transaction data; manual review; stronger fraud, cyber and model-risk control needs |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Fund a bounded onboarding and document-exception pilot with control and value evidence before enterprise expansion.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** An SME customer repeatedly submits the same document while customer service and verification teams show different exception status (invented discovery context, not an actual incident).

**Pilot from Demo 03:** Onboarding document-exception explainer for service and verification staff

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Agent identity model, permission matrix, threat scenarios, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP identity and BTP security behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Under what identity and permissions may OmniCapital's assistant and agents run, and who can widen them?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OCF-P10 Omar Haddad, with OCF-P12 Daniel Weber for the pattern and OCF-P09 Mei Tan for AI governance.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OCF-P06 | Sofia Chen, Chief Digital and Information Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| OCF-P12 | Daniel Weber, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OCF-P10 | Omar Haddad, CISO and Resilience Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OCF-P09 | Mei Tan, Customer Identity and Data Lead | Data and AI governance |
| OCF-P03 | Priya Rao, Chief Customer and Retail Officer | Business owner (first scope) |
| OCF-P08 | Marcus Okoro, Financial Crime Operations Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OCF-P05 | Elena Fischer, Chief Compliance and Conduct Officer | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. What SAP describes (public documentation, verify)

| Capability | What the documentation or SAP community describes | Use in this design |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Cloud Identity Services (Identity Authentication, Identity Provisioning) | Sign-in, tokens and user provisioning across SAP and non-SAP systems | Identity for people and applications |
| App-to-app OAuth2 client credentials | In an SAP community example the token identifies the application, not the end user; the agent checks signature, issuer, audience, expiry and a scope claim | Agent identity; user-level access needs principal propagation, so verify |
| Agent-to-agent protocol and BTP Destinations | An SAP community example secures an agent with a middleware and calls it through a destination using OAuth2 client credentials | Pattern for agent calls; verify for current versions |
| Role collections and authorizations on BTP | Roles are grouped into role collections and assigned to users | Human roles for approvals |

## 7. Identity and permission model (new design)

| Principle | Design |
|---|---|
| Two identities | The user's identity decides what data is visible; the agent's own identity decides which tools it may call |
| Least privilege | Each tool has its own scope; no wildcard scopes |
| Read before write | Agents start read-only; write tools are drafts that a person confirms |
| Approvals | Bound to one action, expire quickly, recorded with approver |
| Data minimization | Role filter applied before retrieval; identifiers masked |
| Untrusted text | Retrieved text is data and cannot trigger a tool call |
| Audit | Every tool call logged with user, agent, input class and result |

**Tool permission matrix from the Demo 03 pilot**

| Tool | Mode | Approval | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| search_onboarding_policy | Read | None | Returns policy version and jurisdiction |
| get_exception_status | Read | None | Shows each system's status and which is the system of record |
| draft_customer_message | Draft only | Staff member approves | No decision outcome in the text |
| route_to_verification | Creates a task | Verification owns the outcome | Assistant cannot change case status |
| Any approve, reject or limit decision | Not exposed | Not available to the agent | High-impact decisions stay with accountable people |

**Sector boundary:** Privileged production access and credit or risk decisions are never automated by an assistant.

**Never available:** Financial-crime investigation notes; Other customers' data; Model scores about the customer; Instructions found inside submitted documents

## 8. Threat scenarios

| Threat | Control | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Injection in a customer document | Text is data | Seed a document with an instruction |
| Agent granting access | No grant tool | Ask for access |
| Leak across customers | Customer-scoped filters | Query another customer |
| Restricted alert exposure | Topic authorization | Subscribe as a service role |

## 9. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. List every tool the assistant can call and mark its scope and approval.
2. Run the four threat checks on paper and record the expected result.
3. Draw the two identities (user and agent) on the first tool call.
4. Decide who may widen a scope and how the change is approved.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Access grant | An agent is asked to grant privilege | Refused; human approval |
| T2 Alert exposure | A service role requests restricted alerts | Denied; logged |
| T3 Poisoned document | A document instructs a transfer | Ignored; flagged |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Tools with an explicit scope and approval rule | Count against the tool list | Not measured |
| Threat checks with a recorded expected result | Count of four | Not measured |
| Tool calls with audit fields defined | Review | Not measured |
| Scope changes with a named approver | Policy review | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why agents change the threat model | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Identity and permission model | Matrix with scopes |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Threat scenarios | Four checks |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |

## Evidence status and run log

| Hands-on run on a vendor-provided system | Not yet run |
| Customer-confirmed requirements | Not applicable (fictional case) |
