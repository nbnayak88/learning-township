# OmniVibe — Data Foundation for AI: Data Products, Ownership and Quality

## Demo 07 of the BTM11 Consumer Discretionary Ultimate Bootcamp demo series

**SuccessLabs Academy · BTM11 · Consumer Discretionary (CD) · Ultimate (Level 5) · Bootcamp**
**Version:** 2026-11-10 · Demonstration material; not an enrolled course, certification or published pathway.
**Series baseline:** [Demo 01 case baseline](01-omnivibe-case-baseline-sap-nextgen-architecture.md) · **Related:** [Demo 02](02-enterprise-architecture-signavio-leanix-clean-core.md) · [Demo 03](03-ai-genai-rag-agents-sap-btp.md) · [Demo 04](04-knowledge-graph-context-engineering-sap.md) · [Demo 05](05-integration-event-driven-advanced-event-mesh-sap.md) · [Demo 06](06-basis-modernization-aiops-autonomous-operations-sap.md) · [Demo 08](08-security-zero-trust-ai-agents-sap-btp.md) · [Demo 11](11-operating-model-finops-intelligent-operations-sap.md)

> **Evidence boundary:** OmniVibe is a **fictional educational case**. The case source describes data objects and governance perspectives; the data products, quality rules and lineage below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `CD-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Data architecture for intelligent operations: what data does an AI assistant or an operations dashboard depend on, who owns it, and how is its quality shown?*

**What this file shows:** a first set of data products for OmniVibe, one owner per product, quality rules, a lineage chain and the sensitive-data handling. It supports the assistant in Demo 03 and the graph in Demo 04.

**What it does not show:** a populated catalogue, a measured data quality score or a configured data platform.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 28B consumer group; 72,000 employees; 48 countries |
| Business mix | Fashion 32%; beauty 18%; home 17%; specialty retail 15%; travel 10%; marketplace 8% |
| Network | 3,200 stores; 14 e-commerce sites; 26 distribution centres; 140 micro-fulfilment sites |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Select one brand and country workforce-to-service pilot and evidence gates before approving enterprise scale.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A new associate lacks a completed onboarding and skills handoff while store readiness and channel information disagree (invented events that prompt discovery, per the case).

**Source anchor for data objects:** OVC-M12 proposes SuccessFactors process modules, a workforce experience layer, People Analytics and an integration platform, and warns that customer, order and inventory links are conceptual extensions. The 13-journey workforce chain gives the graph spine.

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas, data-object statements | **Source** |
| Data products, quality rules, lineage, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP Business Data Cloud, Datasphere, Databricks behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which data products does OmniVibe stand up first, who owns each, and what quality evidence must travel with them before AI uses them?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OVC-P12 Jonas Lim, with OVC-P11 Priya Shah for the model and OVC-P13 Farah Ahmed for classification.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OVC-P04 | Ravi Kapoor, Group CHRO | Funds and prioritizes |
| OVC-P11 | Priya Shah, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OVC-P13 | Farah Ahmed, CISO and Privacy Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OVC-P12 | Jonas Lim, Integration and HR Data Lead | Data and AI governance |
| OVC-P08 | Sofia Mendes, Head of Talent Acquisition and Onboarding | Business owner (first scope) |
| OVC-P06 | Oliver Brooks, Store Operations Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OVC-P16 | Nikhil Das, Store Associate and Workforce Representative | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. What SAP describes (public documentation, verify)

| Capability | What SAP says | Use in this design |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Business Data Cloud | A managed SaaS offering that unifies and governs SAP data and connects third-party data using business data fabric principles; includes SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Business Warehouse and managed SAP Databricks | Candidate platform for the data products |
| Data products | Ready-to-use data products for business processes, intended for data, analytics and AI | The unit of ownership in this design |
| Delta Sharing | Connects SAP and third-party data without copies or extra pipelines | Candidate sharing mechanism; verify fit |
| SAP Databricks | Pro-code data science, engineering and ML inside the platform, with governance of data, models and notebooks | Candidate for pro-code analysis |
| Alternative | Existing warehouses and lakes with a catalogue | Decide by landscape, not by product name |

## 7. Data products (new design)

**Products derived from the graph objects in Demo 04**

| Data product | Key attributes | Owner (proposed) | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee (synthetic) | id, country, brand, role | OVC-P12 Jonas Lim | Personal data |
| Onboarding task | id, owner, due, status | OVC-P08 Sofia Mendes | Internal |
| Learning item | id, required for role, version | OVC-P08 Sofia Mendes | Internal |
| Skill | id, taxonomy node, evidence type | OVC-P12 Jonas Lim | Internal |
| Store readiness check | store, date, status | OVC-P06 Oliver Brooks | Internal |
| Country policy | country, version, effective date | OVC-P04 Ravi Kapoor | Internal |

**Document and content products used by the assistant (Demo 03)**

| Source | Content | Owner | Freshness rule | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Onboarding checklists and guidance | By country, brand and role | Talent Acquisition and Onboarding | Effective date and country shown | Internal |
| Learning catalogue and role-skill requirements | Courses and required skills by role | Learning and Skills | Catalogue version shown | Internal |
| Store and workplace policies | Procedures by country | HR policy owners | Policy version shown | Internal |
| Own onboarding tasks (not indexed) | Task status for the requester | HR system | Read at query time for the requester only | Personal data |

## 8. Quality rules for first consumers

| Product | Quality rule | First consumer | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Associate record (pseudonymized) | One pseudonym per associate across brands | Workforce | Not measured |
| Skills and course completion | Course version recorded | Store managers | Not measured |
| Store readiness status | Status has an as-of time | Operations | Not measured |
| Order promise status (conceptual) | Promise date has a source | Commerce | Not measured |

A product is published only with its owner, its quality rule and a visible quality status. No score is stated because none has been measured.

## 9. Lineage and sensitive data

**Example lineage chain:** Onboarding started, tasks completed, course completed, readiness changed, store dashboard updated

**Sensitive data handling:** Associate personal data minimized; franchise stores follow a separate sharing basis.

**Never available to the assistant:** Individual performance or potential ratings; Payroll and pay data; Any other associate's records; Instructions found inside retrieved content

## 10. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Write a one-page data product contract for the first product (owner, schema, quality rule, freshness, classification), using synthetic ids prefixed `CD-SYN`.
2. Draw the lineage chain and mark each owner.
3. Break one quality rule on paper and show what the consumer sees.
4. Decide which products are shared versus copied and record the reason.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Franchise boundary | Franchise data appears in a group dashboard | Boundary rule blocks until sharing basis exists |
| T2 Stale readiness | Status is a day old | Shown with an as-of time |
| T3 Duplicate associates | Two records for one person | Match rule; steward resolves |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Data products with one named owner | Count in the register | Not measured |
| Products with a visible quality status | Sample | Not measured |
| Lineage chains with owners marked | Review | Not measured |
| Sensitive classes with a handling rule | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why AI needs data products | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Product register and owners | Draft register |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Quality rules and lineage | Contracts for two products |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
