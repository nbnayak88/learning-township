# OmniVibe — SAP Basis Modernization, AIOps and Autonomous Operations

## Demo 06 of the BTM11 Consumer Discretionary Ultimate Bootcamp demo series

**SuccessLabs Academy · BTM11 · Consumer Discretionary (CD) · Ultimate (Level 5) · Bootcamp**
**Version:** 2026-11-10 · Demonstration material; not an enrolled course, certification or published pathway.
**Series baseline:** [Demo 01 case baseline](01-omnivibe-case-baseline-sap-nextgen-architecture.md) · **Related:** [Demo 02 EA](02-enterprise-architecture-signavio-leanix-clean-core.md) · [Demo 03 AI on SAP BTP](03-ai-genai-rag-agents-sap-btp.md) · [Demo 04](04-knowledge-graph-context-engineering-sap.md) · [Demo 05](05-integration-event-driven-advanced-event-mesh-sap.md)

> **Evidence boundary:** OmniVibe is an **aspirational case study**. The case source contains almost no run-operations detail, so the landscape, signals and rhythm below are synthetic design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `CD-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Basis, HANA monitoring, transport automation, high availability and disaster recovery, and AI-driven operations: what may be automated, and what must stay with a person?*

**What this file shows:** a synthetic operations landscape for OmniVibe, six signals with a response and an autonomy tier, a change and transport policy, and the HA and DR questions to settle.

**What it does not show:** a monitored system, a tested failover or an automated remediation.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 28B consumer group; 72,000 employees; 48 countries |
| Business mix | Fashion 32%; beauty 18%; home 17%; specialty retail 15%; travel 10%; marketplace 8% |
| Network | 3,200 stores; 14 e-commerce sites; 26 distribution centres; 140 micro-fulfilment sites |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Select one brand and country workforce-to-service pilot and evidence gates before approving enterprise scale.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A new associate lacks a completed onboarding and skills handoff while store readiness and channel information disagree (invented events that prompt discovery, per the case).

**Scenario used in this demo:** Campaign and holiday peaks stress commerce and workforce systems at the same time; operations needs to protect store readiness and onboarding services.

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Landscape, signals, tiers, rhythm, HA and DR questions, tests | **New design (synthetic)** |
| SAP operations tooling behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which operational responses may OmniVibe automate, which need human approval, and which are never automated?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OVC-P16 Nikhil Das for operational risk, OVC-P04 Ravi Kapoor for the platform, OVC-P13 Farah Ahmed for access and security.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OVC-P04 | Ravi Kapoor, Group CHRO | Funds operations modernization; accepts residual risk with F |
| OVC-P11 | Priya Shah, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns the operations and transport standard |
| OVC-P13 | Farah Ahmed, CISO and Privacy Lead | Approves privileged access and automation boundaries |
| OVC-P12 | Jonas Lim, Integration and HR Data Lead | Data and AI governance for operational data |
| OVC-P08 | Sofia Mendes, Head of Talent Acquisition and Onboarding | Business owner of the first protected service |
| OVC-P06 | Oliver Brooks, Store Operations Director | Business owner of the second protected service |
| OVC-P16 | Nikhil Das, Store Associate and Workforce Representative | Operational authority; veto where operations or safety are at risk |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. Tooling (public documentation, verify)

| Tool | Documented role | Note |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Cloud ALM | Operations and implementation tooling positioned as the successor to SAP Solution Manager | Does not fully cover change request and ITSM scope; verify |
| SAP Focused Run | Monitoring for large or complex landscapes | Verify fit and licensing |
| SAP HANA Cloud Central or HANA cockpit | Database monitoring and administration | Verify for the deployment model |
| SAP Solution Manager 7.2 | Mainstream maintenance reported to end 2027 with extended maintenance to about 2030 (third-party source) | **Confirm against SAP before planning** |

## 7. Landscape (synthetic)

| Component | Criticality |
|---|---|
| Core HR (cloud) | High: onboarding |
| Workforce scheduling | High: store readiness |
| Order and commerce platform | High: peak revenue |
| Integration platform | High |
| Core ERP on HANA | High |
| Non-production systems | Low |

## 8. Signals, responses and autonomy tiers

**Tiers:** A answer or recommend only; B human-approved action; C never automated.

| Signal | Response | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Onboarding task queue backlog | Summarize; notify the manager role | A answer or recommend only |
| Commerce response time during a campaign | Compare to peak norm; page the on-call | B human-approved action |
| Integration retries rise | Group by interface and owner | A answer or recommend only |
| Batch job overruns into store opening | Recommend priorities; scheduler owner decides | B human-approved action |
| Capacity forecast for the holiday peak | Recommend scale decision for review | A answer or recommend only |
| Request to deploy during peak freeze | Refused unless an exception is approved | C never automated |

**Always tier C:** production HA failover, restore from backup, upgrades, production transport imports and authorization changes.

## 9. Change and transport policy (new design)

| Rule | Design |
|---|---|
| Pipeline | Development, quality, production; no direct production changes |
| Collision check | The pipeline shows two changes touching the same object |
| Freeze windows | Launch campaigns, seasonal peaks and a holiday change freeze (illustrative). |
| Exceptions | Named approver, expiry date and rollback plan recorded |
| Evidence | Each import records who approved and when |

## 10. High availability and disaster recovery questions

**Focus:** Commerce and scheduling first; franchise boundary applies to shared tooling.

| Question | Owner (proposed) | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Recovery time objective per service | OVC-P16 Nikhil Das | To be decided |
| Recovery point objective per service | OVC-P16 Nikhil Das | To be decided |
| Last restore test and its result | OVC-P11 Priya Shah | Evidence slot empty |
| Last failover test and its result | OVC-P11 Priya Shah | Evidence slot empty |
| Who approves a production failover | OVC-P04 Ravi Kapoor | To be named |

## 11. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Take the six signals and write a one-page runbook for the first, including who is called and what is checked.
2. For each signal, confirm the tier and what evidence the operator needs before approving.
3. Draw the change pipeline and mark one collision.
4. List what is missing before any tier B action could be automated further.
5. Record decisions and gaps in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Peak freeze | A change is requested in the freeze | Blocked; exception path with named approver |
| T2 Overrun into opening | A batch overruns | Priority recommendation is advisory; owner decides |
| T3 Wrong scale advice | Forecast uses a stale baseline | Baseline version shown; reviewer rejects |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Signals with a runbook, owner and tier | Count of the six | Not measured |
| Tier C actions with no automated path | Review of the action list | Not measured |
| HA and DR questions with a named owner | Count of five | Not measured |
| Changes with approver and rollback recorded | Sample of the register | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this aspirational case study. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | From monitoring to autonomy: the tiers | Shared vocabulary |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Landscape and signals | Six runbook outlines |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Change pipeline and HA and DR | Policy draft and question list |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
