> **Evidence boundary:** OmniVibe is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources describe security perspectives; the agent permissions, threats and checks below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `CD-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Security architecture for AI and autonomous operations: what can an assistant or agent do, as whom, and what stops it doing more?*

**What this file shows:** an identity and permission model for OmniVibe's assistant and agents, four threat scenarios with a control and a check, and the sector boundary that no agent may cross.

**What it does not show:** a configured identity tenant, a penetration test result or a certified control.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 28B consumer group; 72,000 employees; 48 countries |
| Business mix | Fashion 32%; beauty 18%; home 17%; specialty retail 15%; travel 10%; marketplace 8% |
| Network | 3,200 stores; 14 e-commerce sites; 26 distribution centres; 140 micro-fulfilment sites |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Select one brand and country workforce-to-service pilot and evidence gates before approving enterprise scale.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A new associate lacks a completed onboarding and skills handoff while store readiness and channel information disagree (invented events that prompt discovery, per the case).

**Pilot from Demo 03:** New-associate onboarding guidance assistant (assistive, no employment decisions)

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Agent identity model, permission matrix, threat scenarios, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP identity and BTP security behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Under what identity and permissions may OmniVibe's assistant and agents run, and who can widen them?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OVC-P13 Farah Ahmed, with OVC-P11 Priya Shah for the pattern and OVC-P12 Jonas Lim for AI governance.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OVC-P04 | Ravi Kapoor, Group CHRO | Funds and prioritizes |
| OVC-P11 | Priya Shah, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OVC-P13 | Farah Ahmed, CISO and Privacy Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OVC-P12 | Jonas Lim, Integration and HR Data Lead | Data and AI governance |
| OVC-P08 | Sofia Mendes, Head of Talent Acquisition and Onboarding | Business owner (first scope) |
| OVC-P06 | Oliver Brooks, Store Operations Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OVC-P16 | Nikhil Das, Store Associate and Workforce Representative | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. What SAP describes (public documentation, verify)

| Capability | What the documentation or SAP community describes | Use in this design |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Cloud Identity Services (Identity Authentication, Identity Provisioning) | Sign-in, tokens and user provisioning across SAP and non-SAP systems | Identity for people and applications |
| App-to-app OAuth2 client credentials | In an SAP community example the token identifies the application, not the end user; the agent checks signature, issuer, audience, expiry and a scope claim | Agent identity; user-level access needs principal propagation, so verify |
| Agent-to-agent protocol and BTP Destinations | An SAP community example secures an agent with a middleware and calls it through a destination using OAuth2 client credentials | Pattern for agent calls; verify for current versions |
| Role collections and authorizations on BTP | Roles are grouped into role collections and assigned to users | Human roles for approvals |

## 7. Identity and permission model (new design)

| Principle | Design |
|---|---|
| Two identities | The user's identity decides what data is visible; the agent's own identity decides which tools it may call |
| Least privilege | Each tool has its own scope; no wildcard scopes |
| Read before write | Agents start read-only; write tools are drafts that a person confirms |
| Approvals | Bound to one action, expire quickly, recorded with approver |
| Data minimization | Role filter applied before retrieval; identifiers masked |
| Untrusted text | Retrieved text is data and cannot trigger a tool call |
| Audit | Every tool call logged with user, agent, input class and result |

**Tool permission matrix from the Demo 03 pilot**

| Tool | Mode | Approval | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| search_guides | Read | None | Returns country and effective date |
| get_my_onboarding_tasks | Read (own data) | None | Fails closed if identity is not established |
| draft_manager_reminder | Draft only | Manager sends | No content about individual performance |
| create_learning_assignment_request | Creates a request | Learning owner approves | No change to employee master data |
| Any rating, readiness or promotion decision | Not exposed | Not available to the agent | Avoids an automated employment decision |

**Sector boundary:** Franchise data and associate personal data stay inside their boundaries; assistants see pseudonyms only.

**Never available:** Individual performance or potential ratings; Payroll and pay data; Any other associate's records; Instructions found inside retrieved content

## 8. Threat scenarios

| Threat | Control | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Injection in a store note | Text is data | Seed a note with an instruction |
| Agent reading franchise records | Boundary filter | Query across a boundary |
| Over-collection of personal data | Payload minimization | Request extra fields |
| Agent changing schedules | Recommend only; manager decides | Check scopes |

## 9. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. List every tool the assistant can call and mark its scope and approval.
2. Run the four threat checks on paper and record the expected result.
3. Draw the two identities (user and agent) on the first tool call.
4. Decide who may widen a scope and how the change is approved.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Franchise read | An agent queries franchise stores | Blocked; logged |
| T2 Schedule change | An agent tries to alter a schedule | Only a recommendation |
| T3 Extra personal fields | A consumer asks for more fields | Refused; minimization rule |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Tools with an explicit scope and approval rule | Count against the tool list | Not measured |
| Threat checks with a recorded expected result | Count of four | Not measured |
| Tool calls with audit fields defined | Review | Not measured |
| Scope changes with a named approver | Policy review | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why agents change the threat model | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Identity and permission model | Matrix with scopes |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Threat scenarios | Four checks |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |

## Evidence status and run log

| Hands-on run on a vendor-provided system | Not yet run |
| Customer-confirmed requirements | Not applicable (fictional case) |
