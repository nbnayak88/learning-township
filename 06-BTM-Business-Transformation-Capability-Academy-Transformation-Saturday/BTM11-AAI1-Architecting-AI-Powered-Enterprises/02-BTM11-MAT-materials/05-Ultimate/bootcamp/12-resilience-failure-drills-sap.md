> **Evidence boundary:** OmniForge Materials is an **aspirational case study**. The case sources hold little resilience detail; the drills, degraded modes and tests below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `MAT-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *What happens on the worst day, who knows what to do, and what evidence shows the plan was ever tested?*

**What this file shows:** five failure drills for OmniForge with an expected behaviour and an owner, a degraded mode, a third-party dependency and the rule that a resilience claim needs test evidence.

**What it does not show:** a tested failover, a recovery time or an audited continuity plan.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 42B materials group; 46,000 employees; 31 countries |
| Business mix | Steel and alloys 30%; cement and aggregates 22%; chemicals 20%; mining and minerals 16%; advanced materials 12% |
| Burning platform | Disconnected mining, production, logistics, quality, sales and recycling; 180+ applications; weak material genealogy; manual ESG reconciliation |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Select a bounded materials-traceability and reliability pilot before committing an enterprise rollout.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A customer queries a shipped batch's certificate after a laboratory correction, while a kiln reliability alert and uncertain recycled-feedstock records expose the same trust gap (illustrative hero trigger in the case).

**Scenario from Demo 06:** A plant-adjacent enterprise system degrades during a production campaign; operations must separate enterprise IT health from OT, which this design never controls.

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Drills, degraded mode, evidence rule, tests | **New design (synthetic)** |
| SAP and cloud recovery capabilities | Not exercised here; verify per deployment |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which failures does OmniForge rehearse first, who runs each drill, and what counts as passed?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OMF-P16 Nikhil Sen, with OMF-P04 Sofia de Vries accepting residual risk.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OMF-P04 | Sofia de Vries, Chief Digital and Sustainability Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| OMF-P13 | Priya Nair, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OMF-P12 | Hassan Al-Farsi, CISO and OT Security Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OMF-P14 | Diego Alvarez, Head of Data Governance and AI | Data and AI governance |
| OMF-P08 | Rohan Kulkarni, Head of Quality and Laboratories | Business owner (first scope) |
| OMF-P07 | Elena Petrova, Cement Plant Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OMF-P16 | Nikhil Sen, Shift Supervisor and Workforce Representative | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. Services at stake (from Demo 06)

| Component | Criticality |
|---|---|
| Core ERP on HANA | High: batch, quality, finance |
| Laboratory and certificate system | High: customer commitments |
| Plant edge gateway | High: only passive data exchange from OT |
| Integration platform | High |
| Analytics and ESG data store | Medium |
| Non-production systems | Low |

## 7. Failure drills (new design)

| Drill | Injected failure | Expected behaviour | Drill owner (proposed) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Laboratory interface outage | Lab feed down for hours | Queue retained; certificate issue paused with notice | OMF-P08 Rohan Kulkarni | Not run |
| Edge gateway loss | Plant gateway disconnected | Enterprise shows stale data; no action toward OT | OMF-P07 Elena Petrova | Not run |
| Backup failure before a campaign | Backup fails | Incident; restore evidence reviewed | OMF-P16 Nikhil Sen | Not run |
| Supplier portal outage | Declarations unavailable | Gap visible; no claim | OMF-P14 Diego Alvarez | Not run |
| Certificate service degraded | Slow responses at peak | Priority queue for customer-bound certificates | OMF-P13 Priya Nair | Not run |

**Pass rule:** a drill passes only when an owner followed a written runbook, the expected behaviour was observed, and the evidence is recorded. Nothing is stated as passed in this file.

## 8. Degraded mode and dependencies

| Item | Design |
|---|---|
| Degraded mode | Manual certificate review by Quality with a paper log, reconciled afterwards. |
| Exit criteria | Named owner, review date and a reconciliation task before returning to normal |
| Third-party dependency | Supplier declarations and logistics partners. |
| Owner of the third-party contact | To be named |
| Actions never automated | Production failover, restore from backup, upgrades, production transport imports and authorization changes (tier C, Demo 06) |

## 9. Evidence rule

| Claim | Evidence required | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Backup exists | Job log with date | Evidence slot empty |
| Restore works | Restore test record with result | Evidence slot empty |
| Failover works | Failover test record with result | Evidence slot empty |
| Staff know the runbook | Drill record with participants | Evidence slot empty |

A claim without evidence is written as untested.

## 10. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Choose one drill and write its runbook in ten lines.
2. Assign the owner and a second person.
3. Run the drill on paper and mark where the runbook was unclear.
4. Write the exit criteria for the degraded mode.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Stale data read as live | Edge data is old | As-of time shown; decisions held |
| T2 Untested backup | Backup succeeded, restore never tested | No resilience claim |
| T3 Manual mode drift | Manual certificates continue | Review date and exit criteria |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Drills with a runbook, owner and second person | Count of five | Not measured |
| Resilience claims with recorded evidence | Count against the evidence table | Not measured |
| Degraded modes with exit criteria | Review | Not measured |
| Third-party contacts with a named owner | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this aspirational case study. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | From DR plans to drills | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | The five drills | Owners and expected behaviour |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Runbook and degraded mode | One runbook written |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |

## Evidence status and run log

| Item | Status |

| Design in this file | Written |
| Walk-through with a live audience | Not yet run |
| Hands-on run on a vendor-provided system | Not yet run |
| Customer-confirmed requirements | Not applicable (aspirational case study) |

| Date | Audience | Exercise run | Observed result | Changes made |
