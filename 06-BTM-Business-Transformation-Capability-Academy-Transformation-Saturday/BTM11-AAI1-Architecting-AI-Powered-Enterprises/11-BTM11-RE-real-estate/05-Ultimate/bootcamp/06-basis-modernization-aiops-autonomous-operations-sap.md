# OmniSpace — SAP Basis Modernization, AIOps and Autonomous Operations

## Demo 06 of the BTM11 Real Estate Ultimate Bootcamp demo series

**SuccessLabs Academy · BTM11 · Real Estate (RE) · Ultimate (Level 5) · Bootcamp**
**Version:** 2026-11-10 · Demonstration material; not an enrolled course, certification or published pathway.
**Series baseline:** [Demo 01 case baseline](01-omnispace-case-baseline-sap-nextgen-architecture.md) · **Related:** [Demo 02 EA](02-enterprise-architecture-signavio-leanix-clean-core.md) · [Demo 03 AI on SAP BTP](03-ai-genai-rag-agents-sap-btp.md) · [Demo 04](04-knowledge-graph-context-engineering-sap.md) · [Demo 05](05-integration-event-driven-advanced-event-mesh-sap.md)

> **Evidence boundary:** OmniSpace is an **aspirational case study**. The case source contains almost no run-operations detail, so the landscape, signals and rhythm below are synthetic design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `RE-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Basis, HANA monitoring, transport automation, high availability and disaster recovery, and AI-driven operations: what may be automated, and what must stay with a person?*

**What this file shows:** a synthetic operations landscape for OmniSpace, six signals with a response and an autonomy tier, a change and transport policy, and the HA and DR questions to settle.

**What it does not show:** a monitored system, a tested failover or an automated remediation.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | Not supplied in the case; no enterprise numerical profile, budget or quantified benefits |
| Scope | Aspirational global real-estate enterprise; property, tenant, ESG, recruiting, finance and procurement workstreams |
| Source problem | Fragmented architecture, processes, delivery evidence and adoption |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Select one capability or process pilot and prove its strategy-to-value traceability before scaling tools.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A property-service workflow is declared live, but property teams still use spreadsheets, tenant requests remain unresolved, and test and adoption records cannot explain the claimed benefit (invented learning scenario).

**Scenario used in this demo:** A property-service landscape is small; operations has no baseline, and spreadsheets still carry work. A first step is visibility, not autonomy.

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Landscape, signals, tiers, rhythm, HA and DR questions, tests | **New design (synthetic)** |
| SAP operations tooling behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which operational responses may OmniSpace automate, which need human approval, and which are never automated?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OSP-P14 Ingrid Sørensen for operational risk, OSP-P05 Sofia Tan for the platform, OSP-P09 Omar Haddad for access and security.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OSP-P05 | Sofia Tan, Chief Digital and Information Officer | Funds operations modernization; accepts residual risk with F |
| OSP-P10 | Daniel Weber, Enterprise Architecture Director | Owns the operations and transport standard |
| OSP-P09 | Omar Haddad, CISO and Resilience Lead | Approves privileged access and automation boundaries |
| OSP-P08 | Mei Lin, Enterprise Data and ESG Lead | Data and AI governance for operational data |
| OSP-P03 | Maya Patel, Property Operations Director | Business owner of the first protected service |
| OSP-P16 | Thomas van Dijk, Value Realization Office Lead | Business owner of the second protected service |
| OSP-P14 | Ingrid Sørensen, Adoption and Change Lead | Operational authority; veto where operations or safety are at risk |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. Tooling (public documentation, verify)

| Tool | Documented role | Note |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Cloud ALM | Operations and implementation tooling positioned as the successor to SAP Solution Manager | Does not fully cover change request and ITSM scope; verify |
| SAP Focused Run | Monitoring for large or complex landscapes | Verify fit and licensing |
| SAP HANA Cloud Central or HANA cockpit | Database monitoring and administration | Verify for the deployment model |
| SAP Solution Manager 7.2 | Mainstream maintenance reported to end 2027 with extended maintenance to about 2030 (third-party source) | **Confirm against SAP before planning** |

## 7. Landscape (synthetic)

| Component | Criticality |
|---|---|
| Property operations application | High |
| Tenant request channel | High |
| Integration layer | Medium |
| Core ERP on HANA (finance) | High |
| Reporting store | Medium |
| Non-production systems | Low |

## 8. Signals, responses and autonomy tiers

**Tiers:** A answer or recommend only; B human-approved action; C never automated.

| Signal | Response | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant request channel unavailable | Page on-call; tenant notice by owner | B human-approved action |
| Failed integration job | Summarize the failure | A answer or recommend only |
| Work-order sync delay | Show delay and owner | A answer or recommend only |
| Transport import error | Summarize object and owner | A answer or recommend only |
| Reporting store growth | Recommend review | A answer or recommend only |
| Request to retire a spreadsheet process without owner sign-off | Refused | C never automated |

**Always tier C:** production HA failover, restore from backup, upgrades, production transport imports and authorization changes.

## 9. Change and transport policy (new design)

| Rule | Design |
|---|---|
| Pipeline | Development, quality, production; no direct production changes |
| Collision check | The pipeline shows two changes touching the same object |
| Freeze windows | Rent cycles and month-end (illustrative). |
| Exceptions | Named approver, expiry date and rollback plan recorded |
| Evidence | Each import records who approved and when |

## 10. High availability and disaster recovery questions

**Focus:** Service channel and finance links first; most items are tier A on purpose.

| Question | Owner (proposed) | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Recovery time objective per service | OSP-P14 Ingrid Sørensen | To be decided |
| Recovery point objective per service | OSP-P14 Ingrid Sørensen | To be decided |
| Last restore test and its result | OSP-P10 Daniel Weber | Evidence slot empty |
| Last failover test and its result | OSP-P10 Daniel Weber | Evidence slot empty |
| Who approves a production failover | OSP-P05 Sofia Tan | To be named |

## 11. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Take the six signals and write a one-page runbook for the first, including who is called and what is checked.
2. For each signal, confirm the tier and what evidence the operator needs before approving.
3. Draw the change pipeline and mark one collision.
4. List what is missing before any tier B action could be automated further.
5. Record decisions and gaps in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Visibility first | A request asks for autonomous remediation with no monitoring in place | Declined; monitoring baseline comes first |
| T2 Spreadsheet shadow | Work runs outside the system | Coverage gap reported; no claim of adoption |
| T3 Unowned retirement | A spreadsheet is switched off | Blocked until the owner signs off |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Signals with a runbook, owner and tier | Count of the six | Not measured |
| Tier C actions with no automated path | Review of the action list | Not measured |
| HA and DR questions with a named owner | Count of five | Not measured |
| Changes with approver and rollback recorded | Sample of the register | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this aspirational case study. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | From monitoring to autonomy: the tiers | Shared vocabulary |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Landscape and signals | Six runbook outlines |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Change pipeline and HA and DR | Policy draft and question list |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
