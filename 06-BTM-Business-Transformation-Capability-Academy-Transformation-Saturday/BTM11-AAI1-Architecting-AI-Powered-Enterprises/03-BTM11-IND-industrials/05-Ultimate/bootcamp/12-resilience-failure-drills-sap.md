> **Evidence boundary:** OmniWorks Industrial Systems Ltd. is an **aspirational case study**. The case sources hold little resilience detail; the drills, degraded modes and tests below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `IND-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *What happens on the worst day, who knows what to do, and what evidence shows the plan was ever tested?*

**What this file shows:** five failure drills for OmniWorks with an expected behaviour and an owner, a degraded mode, a third-party dependency and the rule that a resilience claim needs test evidence.

**What it does not show:** a tested failover, a recovery time or an audited continuity plan.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 48B revenue; 74,000 employees; 36 countries; 61 plants and facilities; 320 service depots; 7,200 suppliers |
| Business mix | Industrial automation 27%; aerospace and defence 23%; transport and mobility 19%; infrastructure 16%; aftermarket and lifecycle services 15% |
| Burning platform | Recurring transport asset failures cannot be consistently traced across configuration, telemetry, supplier batches and maintenance history |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Turn a USD 575M transformation envelope into credible customer, operational and financial value without disrupting safety-critical operations.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** Repeat customer asset failures expose fragmented engineering-to-service information, and the business wants to sell uptime rather than equipment (hero story).

**Scenario from Demo 06:** Service peaks overload the enterprise landscape while an engineering release is being transported; operators need to know whether the issue is capacity, a transport or an interface.

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Drills, degraded mode, evidence rule, tests | **New design (synthetic)** |
| SAP and cloud recovery capabilities | Not exercised here; verify per deployment |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which failures does OmniWorks rehearse first, who runs each drill, and what counts as passed?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OW-P12 Daniel Okafor, with OW-P05 Priya Nair accepting residual risk.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OW-P05 | Priya Nair, CIDO | Funds and prioritizes |
| OW-P11 | Hannah Fischer, Director, Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OW-P06 | Marcus Vogel, CISO | Security and boundary approval |
| OW-P15 | Dr. Leila Haddad, Head of Data Governance & AI | Data and AI governance |
| OW-P09 | Isabel Torres, Chief Customer & Service Officer | Business owner (first scope) |
| OW-P10 | Ravi Deshpande, VP Manufacturing, Pune Operations | Business owner (second scope) |
| OW-P12 | Daniel Okafor, Field Service Operations Manager | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. Services at stake (from Demo 06)

| Component | Criticality |
|---|---|
| Core ERP on HANA | High |
| Field service application | High: dispatch and parts |
| PLM system | High: configuration baseline |
| Integration platform | High |
| Customer portal | Medium |
| Non-production systems | Low |

## 7. Failure drills (new design)

| Drill | Injected failure | Expected behaviour | Drill owner (proposed) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dispatch system outage | Field service unavailable | Depots use a fallback list; reconcile afterwards | OW-P09 Isabel Torres | Not run |
| PLM interface failure | Engineering changes stop flowing | Baseline marked stale; no new releases to service | OW-P10 Ravi Deshpande | Not run |
| Portal outage | Customer portal down | Notices by owner; events retained | OW-P11 Hannah Fischer | Not run |
| Peak overload | Service peak plus release | Freeze; priority classes | OW-P12 Daniel Okafor | Not run |
| Edge gateway loss | OT gateway disconnected | Stale data labelled; no action to OT | OW-P06 Marcus Vogel | Not run |

**Pass rule:** a drill passes only when an owner followed a written runbook, the expected behaviour was observed, and the evidence is recorded. Nothing is stated as passed in this file.

## 8. Degraded mode and dependencies

| Item | Design |
|---|---|
| Degraded mode | Paper or phone dispatch with a reconciliation task. |
| Exit criteria | Named owner, review date and a reconciliation task before returning to normal |
| Third-party dependency | Suppliers and depot partners. |
| Owner of the third-party contact | To be named |
| Actions never automated | Production failover, restore from backup, upgrades, production transport imports and authorization changes (tier C, Demo 06) |

## 9. Evidence rule

| Claim | Evidence required | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Backup exists | Job log with date | Evidence slot empty |
| Restore works | Restore test record with result | Evidence slot empty |
| Failover works | Failover test record with result | Evidence slot empty |
| Staff know the runbook | Drill record with participants | Evidence slot empty |

A claim without evidence is written as untested.

## 10. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Choose one drill and write its runbook in ten lines.
2. Assign the owner and a second person.
3. Run the drill on paper and mark where the runbook was unclear.
4. Write the exit criteria for the degraded mode.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Dispatch without baseline | Dispatch continues on a stale baseline | Stale label and owner decision |
| T2 Fallback list gaps | Fallback list is out of date | Owner and review date |
| T3 Peak overload | Overload hits during a release | Freeze rule |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Drills with a runbook, owner and second person | Count of five | Not measured |
| Resilience claims with recorded evidence | Count against the evidence table | Not measured |
| Degraded modes with exit criteria | Review | Not measured |
| Third-party contacts with a named owner | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this aspirational case study. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | From DR plans to drills | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | The five drills | Owners and expected behaviour |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Runbook and degraded mode | One runbook written |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |

## Evidence status and run log

| Item | Status |

| Walk-through with a live audience | Not yet run |
| Hands-on run on a vendor-provided system | Not yet run |
| Customer-confirmed requirements | Not applicable (aspirational case study) |

| Date | Audience | Exercise run | Observed result | Changes made |
