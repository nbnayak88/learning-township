> **Evidence boundary:** OmniVerse Energy Ltd. is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources hold little resilience detail; the drills, degraded modes and tests below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `ENE-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *What happens on the worst day, who knows what to do, and what evidence shows the plan was ever tested?*

**What this file shows:** five failure drills for OmniVerse with an expected behaviour and an owner, a degraded mode, a third-party dependency and the rule that a resilience claim needs test evidence.

**What it does not show:** a tested failover, a recovery time or an audited continuity plan.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 85B revenue; 68,000 employees; 42 countries |
| Business mix | Upstream 35%; refining and petrochemicals 28%; retail and marketing 18%; power 12%; renewables 7% |
| Assets | 8 refineries; 25,000 km pipelines; 12,500 retail sites; 15 GW generation |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Which AI use cases stay assistive, which may trigger human-approved actions, and which low-risk processes may be automated (OVE-HR11 strategic dilemma).

**Illustrative trigger (source):** In the OVE-HR11 decision scenes, an employee (Rina) receives incorrect promotion guidance from an assistant, while HR operations wants automatic data corrections and case closure and a worker representative challenges sentiment inference and productivity scoring.

**Scenario from Demo 06:** A refinery access change fails to propagate and the operations team has no single view of the integration, identity and HR landscape health (new design on the HR12 incident scene).

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Drills, degraded mode, evidence rule, tests | **New design (synthetic)** |
| SAP and cloud recovery capabilities | Not exercised here; verify per deployment |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which failures does OmniVerse rehearse first, who runs each drill, and what counts as passed?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OVE-P04 Farah Al-Hassan, with OVE-P05 Rajiv Kapoor accepting residual risk.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OVE-P05 | Rajiv Kapoor, Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDIO) | Funds and prioritizes |
| OVE-P12 | Hannah Fischer, Director of Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OVE-P13 | Omar Haddad, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | Security and boundary approval |
| OVE-P16 | Dr. Leila Haddad, Head of Data Governance and AI | Data and AI governance |
| OVE-P09 | Carlos Mendes, VP Asset Reliability and Maintenance | Business owner (first scope) |
| OVE-P10 | Grace Okafor, Chief Customer and Retail Officer | Business owner (second scope) |
| OVE-P04 | Farah Al-Hassan, Chief Operating Officer (COO) | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. Services at stake (from Demo 06)

| Component | Criticality |
|---|---|
| HR core system (cloud) | High: lifecycle source |
| Identity and access system | High: access decisions |
| Integration platform and event broker | High: carries lifecycle events |
| Core ERP on HANA | High: payroll, finance links |
| Reporting and analytics store | Medium |
| Non-production systems | Low: but source of transport risk |

## 7. Failure drills (new design)

| Drill | Injected failure | Expected behaviour | Drill owner (proposed) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Event broker outage | Broker unavailable for a period | Producers retain; replay on recovery; pending exceptions visible | OVE-P12 Hannah Fischer | Not run |
| Identity system outage | Access system unreachable | Termination events pend; manual escalation to the access owner | OVE-P13 Omar Haddad | Not run |
| HR system degraded | Slow responses at payroll close | Priorities set; no unapproved batch jobs | OVE-P04 Farah Al-Hassan | Not run |
| Restore from backup | Corrupt interface configuration | Restore evidence reviewed; tier C approval | OVE-P05 Rajiv Kapoor | Not run |
| Partner outage | Security contractor system unreachable | Fallback list and owner documented | OVE-P13 Omar Haddad | Not run |

**Pass rule:** a drill passes only when an owner followed a written runbook, the expected behaviour was observed, and the evidence is recorded. Nothing is stated as passed in this file.

## 8. Degraded mode and dependencies

| Item | Design |
|---|---|
| Degraded mode | Manual access-removal list owned by the access owner, reconciled afterwards. |
| Exit criteria | Named owner, review date and a reconciliation task before returning to normal |
| Third-party dependency | Contractor and security vendor systems tied to site access. |
| Owner of the third-party contact | To be named |
| Actions never automated | Production failover, restore from backup, upgrades, production transport imports and authorization changes (tier C, Demo 06) |

## 9. Evidence rule

| Claim | Evidence required | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Backup exists | Job log with date | Evidence slot empty |
| Restore works | Restore test record with result | Evidence slot empty |
| Failover works | Failover test record with result | Evidence slot empty |
| Staff know the runbook | Drill record with participants | Evidence slot empty |

A claim without evidence is written as untested.

## 10. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Choose one drill and write its runbook in ten lines.
2. Assign the owner and a second person.
3. Run the drill on paper and mark where the runbook was unclear.
4. Write the exit criteria for the degraded mode.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Silent drill gap | A drill finds no owner for a step | Step blocked from production until owned |
| T2 Evidence missing | A claimed DR test has no record | Evidence slot stays empty; no resilience claim |
| T3 Degraded mode stuck | Manual mode continues for days | Review date and exit criteria forced |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Drills with a runbook, owner and second person | Count of five | Not measured |
| Resilience claims with recorded evidence | Count against the evidence table | Not measured |
| Degraded modes with exit criteria | Review | Not measured |
| Third-party contacts with a named owner | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | From DR plans to drills | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | The five drills | Owners and expected behaviour |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Runbook and degraded mode | One runbook written |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |

## Evidence status and run log

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Design in this file | Written |
| Walk-through with a live audience | Not yet run |
| Hands-on run on a vendor-provided system | Not yet run |
| Customer-confirmed requirements | Not applicable (fictional case) |

| Date | Audience | Exercise run | Observed result | Changes made |
|---|---|---|---|---|
