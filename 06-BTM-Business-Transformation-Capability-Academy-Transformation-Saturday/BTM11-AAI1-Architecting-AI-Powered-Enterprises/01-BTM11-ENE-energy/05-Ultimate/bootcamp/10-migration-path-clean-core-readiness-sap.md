> **Evidence boundary:** OmniVerse Energy Ltd. is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources describe a target and a trigger but no current SAP estate; the options, waves and readiness questions below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `ENE-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *How does an enterprise get from its current landscape to a clean-core, event-aware, AI-ready architecture without stopping the business?*

**What this file shows:** the path options, a sequence of waves for OmniVerse, the custom-code questions to ask before any wave, readiness gates and a rule for exceptions.

**What it does not show:** an inventory of a real estate, a migration estimate or a go-live plan. No durations or costs are stated.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 85B revenue; 68,000 employees; 42 countries |
| Business mix | Upstream 35%; refining and petrochemicals 28%; retail and marketing 18%; power 12%; renewables 7% |
| Assets | 8 refineries; 25,000 km pipelines; 12,500 retail sites; 15 GW generation |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Which AI use cases stay assistive, which may trigger human-approved actions, and which low-risk processes may be automated (OVE-HR11 strategic dilemma).

**Illustrative trigger (source):** In the OVE-HR11 decision scenes, an employee (Rina) receives incorrect promotion guidance from an assistant, while HR operations wants automatic data corrections and case closure and a worker representative challenges sentiment inference and productivity scoring.

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas, capabilities and value streams | **Source** |
| Path leaning, waves, readiness gates, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP migration tooling and programmes | Public SAP documentation not reviewed in depth for this demo; **verify before use** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which path and which first wave does OmniVerse choose, and what must be true before each wave starts?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OVE-P05 Rajiv Kapoor, with OVE-P12 Hannah Fischer for architecture and OVE-P04 Farah Al-Hassan for operational readiness.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OVE-P05 | Rajiv Kapoor, Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDIO) | Funds and prioritizes |
| OVE-P12 | Hannah Fischer, Director of Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OVE-P13 | Omar Haddad, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | Security and boundary approval |
| OVE-P16 | Dr. Leila Haddad, Head of Data Governance and AI | Data and AI governance |
| OVE-P09 | Carlos Mendes, VP Asset Reliability and Maintenance | Business owner (first scope) |
| OVE-P10 | Grace Okafor, Chief Customer and Retail Officer | Business owner (second scope) |
| OVE-P04 | Farah Al-Hassan, Chief Operating Officer (COO) | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. Path options (new design, generic)

| Option | Idea | Favoured when | Main risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Greenfield | Start a new system and move selected data | The current estate is hard to fix and the business can accept redesign | Loss of useful history; long parallel running |
| Brownfield (system conversion) | Convert the existing system in place | Processes are stable and custom code can be remediated | Carries old customisation forward |
| Selective or bluefield | Move chosen processes or data, redesign others | Some areas need change and others do not | Needs clear scope rules and data ownership |
| Side-by-side first | Build new capability on BTP and leave the core alone | The business need is new and the core is stable | Integration sprawl without the admission rule |

**Leaning for this case:** Choose per system, not per enterprise. The case describes a large estate; a bluefield or selective path suits where the HR and identity landscapes can change in waves. This is a hypothesis for discovery, not a recommendation.

## 7. Waves (new design)

| Wave | Scope |
|---|---|
| Wave 1 | the employee lifecycle event chain (source anchor HR12) |
| Wave 2 | workforce planning and learning links |
| Wave 3 | remaining HR processes after the pattern is stable |

**Wave entry gates:** inventory complete for the wave; owners named; Clean Core admission rule applied to every extension; rollback path written; freeze calendar checked; evidence slots for tests prepared.

## 8. Custom code and extension readiness

| Question | Why it matters | Evidence needed | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Which custom objects touch this wave? | Hidden dependencies stop a wave | Usage and owner for each | Not collected |
| Which are still used? | Unused code is retired, not migrated | Usage evidence | Not collected |
| Which extensions fit the Clean Core levels? | Decides migrate, rebuild or retire (Demo 02) | Level assessment | Not collected |
| Which interfaces must stay unchanged? | Protects partners and operations | Interface list with owners | Not collected |

**Sector readiness questions:**

- Which interfaces carry lifecycle events today and who owns each?
- Which custom objects touch employee status?
- Which refinery systems depend on access timing?
- What is the freeze calendar around shifts and payroll?

## 9. Exceptions

An exception to a gate needs a named approver, an expiry date, a rollback plan and a note in the decision record. Exceptions that repeat become a design review item.

## 10. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. List ten synthetic custom objects (prefix `ENE-SYN`) and place each in migrate, rebuild or retire with a reason.
2. Order the three waves and write the entry gate for the first.
3. Mark the freeze calendar and test the first wave date against it.
4. Write one exception and its expiry.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Hidden interface | An undocumented interface carries terminations | Inventory gate blocks the wave until it is registered |
| T2 Wave collides with payroll | A cutover date meets payroll close | Calendar rule moves the wave; owner signs |
| T3 Extension without rule | A team proposes a custom object on employee status | Admission rule from Demo 02 decides |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Waves with all entry gates met on paper | Review of the gate list | Not measured |
| Custom objects with owner and usage evidence | Count against the inventory | Not measured |
| Exceptions with approver and expiry | Count | Not measured |
| Rollback paths written per wave | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Path options and why not one answer | Shared options |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Waves and gates | Wave plan without dates |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Custom code triage | Ten objects placed |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
