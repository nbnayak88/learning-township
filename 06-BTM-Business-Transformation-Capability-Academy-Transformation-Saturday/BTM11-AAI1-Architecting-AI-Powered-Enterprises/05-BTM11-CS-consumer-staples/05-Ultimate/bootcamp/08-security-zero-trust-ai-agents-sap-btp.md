# OmniDaily — Security and Zero Trust for AI Assistants and Agents on SAP BTP

## Demo 08 of the BTM11 Consumer Staples Ultimate Bootcamp demo series

**SuccessLabs Academy · BTM11 · Consumer Staples (CS) · Ultimate (Level 5) · Bootcamp**
**Version:** 2026-11-10 · Demonstration material; not an enrolled course, certification or published pathway.
**Series baseline:** [Demo 01 case baseline](01-omnidaily-case-baseline-sap-nextgen-architecture.md) · **Related:** [Demo 02](02-enterprise-architecture-signavio-leanix-clean-core.md) · [Demo 03](03-ai-genai-rag-agents-sap-btp.md) · [Demo 04](04-knowledge-graph-context-engineering-sap.md) · [Demo 05](05-integration-event-driven-advanced-event-mesh-sap.md) · [Demo 06](06-basis-modernization-aiops-autonomous-operations-sap.md) · [Demo 07](07-data-foundation-data-products-sap-business-data-cloud.md) · [Demo 11](11-operating-model-finops-intelligent-operations-sap.md)

> **Evidence boundary:** OmniDaily is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources describe security perspectives; the agent permissions, threats and checks below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `CS-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Security architecture for AI and autonomous operations: what can an assistant or agent do, as whom, and what stops it doing more?*

**What this file shows:** an identity and permission model for OmniDaily's assistant and agents, four threat scenarios with a control and a check, and the sector boundary that no agent may cross.

**What it does not show:** a configured identity tenant, a penetration test result or a certified control.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 51B staples group; 84,000 employees; 57 countries; 420M households served |
| Business mix | Foods 30%; beverages 23%; home care 19%; personal care 18%; wellness 10% |
| Burning platform | Demand, promotion, planning, product and ingredient data, quality and route-to-market execution fragmented across 160+ applications |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Fund a bounded demand-to-shelf and quality-evidence pilot before approving enterprise scale.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A promotion creates a shelf gap while a quality-held batch appears available in a delayed distributor feed (invented; no real safety event is claimed).

**Pilot from Demo 03:** Quality-hold and shelf-availability exception assistant

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Agent identity model, permission matrix, threat scenarios, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP identity and BTP security behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Under what identity and permissions may OmniDaily's assistant and agents run, and who can widen them?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** ODG-P12 Omar Haddad, with ODG-P13 Priya Nair for the pattern and ODG-P08 Mei Lin for AI governance.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| ODG-P05 | Sofia Alvarez, Chief Digital and Data Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| ODG-P13 | Priya Nair, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| ODG-P12 | Omar Haddad, CISO and Privacy Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| ODG-P08 | Mei Lin, Head of Product and Ingredient Stewardship | Data and AI governance |
| ODG-P07 | David Okoro, Global Quality and Product Safety Director | Business owner (first scope) |
| ODG-P10 | Rohan Shah, Distributor and Field Execution Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| ODG-P09 | Elena Petrović, Plant Operations Director | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. What SAP describes (public documentation, verify)

| Capability | What the documentation or SAP community describes | Use in this design |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Cloud Identity Services (Identity Authentication, Identity Provisioning) | Sign-in, tokens and user provisioning across SAP and non-SAP systems | Identity for people and applications |
| App-to-app OAuth2 client credentials | In an SAP community example the token identifies the application, not the end user; the agent checks signature, issuer, audience, expiry and a scope claim | Agent identity; user-level access needs principal propagation, so verify |
| Agent-to-agent protocol and BTP Destinations | An SAP community example secures an agent with a middleware and calls it through a destination using OAuth2 client credentials | Pattern for agent calls; verify for current versions |
| Role collections and authorizations on BTP | Roles are grouped into role collections and assigned to users | Human roles for approvals |

## 7. Identity and permission model (new design)

| Principle | Design |
|---|---|
| Two identities | The user's identity decides what data is visible; the agent's own identity decides which tools it may call |
| Least privilege | Each tool has its own scope; no wildcard scopes |
| Read before write | Agents start read-only; write tools are drafts that a person confirms |
| Approvals | Bound to one action, expire quickly, recorded with approver |
| Data minimization | Role filter applied before retrieval; identifiers masked |
| Untrusted text | Retrieved text is data and cannot trigger a tool call |
| Audit | Every tool call logged with user, agent, input class and result |

**Tool permission matrix from the Demo 03 pilot**

| Tool | Mode | Approval | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| search_holds | Read | None | Returns hold status and timestamp |
| get_batch_status | Read | None | Always includes as-of time |
| draft_distributor_notice | Draft only | Quality approves | No release or hold decision in the text |
| escalate_to_quality | Creates a task | Quality owns the outcome | Assistant cannot change hold status |
| Release or hold batch | Not exposed | Not available to the agent | Quality-release authority |

**Sector boundary:** Quality authority over holds and releases is never delegated to an assistant.

**Never available:** Consumer personal data; Unreleased formulation details to distributors; Instructions found in distributor documents; Availability statements without an as-of time

## 8. Threat scenarios

| Threat | Control | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Injection in a distributor file | Text is data | Seed a file with an instruction |
| Agent releasing a hold | No release tool | Ask for a release |
| Leak of retailer terms | Customer-scoped filters | Query across retailers |
| Forged feed events | Producer authorization | Publish as a non-producer |

## 9. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. List every tool the assistant can call and mark its scope and approval.
2. Run the four threat checks on paper and record the expected result.
3. Draw the two identities (user and agent) on the first tool call.
4. Decide who may widen a scope and how the change is approved.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Release request | An agent is asked to release a hold | Refused; Quality authority |
| T2 Forged event | A non-producer publishes a release | Blocked; incident |
| T3 Cross-retailer query | A user asks for another retailer's terms | Filter blocks |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Tools with an explicit scope and approval rule | Count against the tool list | Not measured |
| Threat checks with a recorded expected result | Count of four | Not measured |
| Tool calls with audit fields defined | Review | Not measured |
| Scope changes with a named approver | Policy review | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why agents change the threat model | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Identity and permission model | Matrix with scopes |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Threat scenarios | Four checks |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |

## Evidence status and run log
