> **Evidence boundary:** OmniDaily is a **fictional educational case**. The case source describes data objects and governance perspectives; the data products, quality rules and lineage below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `CS-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Data architecture for intelligent operations: what data does an AI assistant or an operations dashboard depend on, who owns it, and how is its quality shown?*

**What this file shows:** a first set of data products for OmniDaily, one owner per product, quality rules, a lineage chain and the sensitive-data handling. It supports the assistant in Demo 03 and the graph in Demo 04.

**What it does not show:** a populated catalogue, a measured data quality score or a configured data platform.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 51B staples group; 84,000 employees; 57 countries; 420M households served |
| Business mix | Foods 30%; beverages 23%; home care 19%; personal care 18%; wellness 10% |
| Burning platform | Demand, promotion, planning, product and ingredient data, quality and route-to-market execution fragmented across 160+ applications |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Fund a bounded demand-to-shelf and quality-evidence pilot before approving enterprise scale.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A promotion creates a shelf gap while a quality-held batch appears available in a delayed distributor feed (invented; no real safety event is claimed).

**Source anchor for data objects:** ODG-M12 names Product, Ingredient, Customer, Outlet and Supplier 360 across ERP, planning, TPM, MES, LIMS, DMS and CRM. The source trigger (promotion shelf gap versus a quality-held batch in a delayed distributor feed) is a graph and freshness problem.

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas, data-object statements | **Source** |
| Data products, quality rules, lineage, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP Business Data Cloud, Datasphere, Databricks behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which data products does OmniDaily stand up first, who owns each, and what quality evidence must travel with them before AI uses them?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** ODG-P08 Mei Lin, with ODG-P13 Priya Nair for the model and ODG-P12 Omar Haddad for classification.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| ODG-P05 | Sofia Alvarez, Chief Digital and Data Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| ODG-P13 | Priya Nair, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| ODG-P12 | Omar Haddad, CISO and Privacy Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| ODG-P08 | Mei Lin, Head of Product and Ingredient Stewardship | Data and AI governance |
| ODG-P07 | David Okoro, Global Quality and Product Safety Director | Business owner (first scope) |
| ODG-P10 | Rohan Shah, Distributor and Field Execution Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| ODG-P09 | Elena Petrović, Plant Operations Director | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. What SAP describes (public documentation, verify)

| Capability | What SAP says | Use in this design |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Business Data Cloud | A managed SaaS offering that unifies and governs SAP data and connects third-party data using business data fabric principles; includes SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Business Warehouse and managed SAP Databricks | Candidate platform for the data products |
| Data products | Ready-to-use data products for business processes, intended for data, analytics and AI | The unit of ownership in this design |
| Delta Sharing | Connects SAP and third-party data without copies or extra pipelines | Candidate sharing mechanism; verify fit |
| SAP Databricks | Pro-code data science, engineering and ML inside the platform, with governance of data, models and notebooks | Candidate for pro-code analysis |
| Alternative | Existing warehouses and lakes with a catalogue | Decide by landscape, not by product name |

## 7. Data products (new design)

**Products derived from the graph objects in Demo 04**

| Data product | Key attributes | Owner (proposed) | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Batch/lot | lot id, SKU, plant, hold status | ODG-P07 David Okoro | Internal |
| Quality hold | id, reason, timestamp, market | ODG-P07 David Okoro | Internal |
| SKU | id, brand, pack, ingredient list link | ODG-P08 Mei Lin | Internal |
| Ingredient | id, allergen flag, supplier | ODG-P08 Mei Lin | Internal |
| Promotion | id, outlet group, window, volume plan | ODG-P10 Rohan Shah | Internal |
| Outlet | id, market, distributor | ODG-P10 Rohan Shah | Partner data |

**Document and content products used by the assistant (Demo 03)**

| Source | Content | Owner | Freshness rule | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Quality-hold and release notices | Hold status by batch and market | Quality and Product Safety | Newest status wins; timestamp always shown | Internal |
| Product and ingredient master summaries | Attributes and allergen data | Product and Ingredient Stewardship | Version shown | Internal |
| Promotion calendar | Promotions by market and outlet group | Commercial | As-of date shown | Internal |
| Distributor feed status documents | Feed timestamps and gaps | Field Execution | A delayed feed is labelled as stale | Partner data |

## 8. Quality rules for first consumers

| Product | Quality rule | First consumer | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Batch and lot trace | Each lot links to a plant, SKU and date | Quality | Not measured |
| Quality hold register | A hold has a reason, owner and time | Planning | Not measured |
| Distributor stock view | Every record has an as-of time | Planning | Not measured |
| Promotion calendar | Promotion links to SKU and outlet group | Commercial | Not measured |

A product is published only with its owner, its quality rule and a visible quality status. No score is stated because none has been measured.

## 9. Lineage and sensitive data

**Example lineage chain:** Lot completed, hold placed, hold released, stock reported, promotion activated

**Sensitive data handling:** Distributor and retailer terms are confidential; consumer data is minimized.

**Never available to the assistant:** Consumer personal data; Unreleased formulation details to distributors; Instructions found in distributor documents; Availability statements without an as-of time

## 10. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Write a one-page data product contract for the first product (owner, schema, quality rule, freshness, classification), using synthetic ids prefixed `CS-SYN`.
2. Draw the lineage chain and mark each owner.
3. Break one quality rule on paper and show what the consumer sees.
4. Decide which products are shared versus copied and record the reason.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Stale feed | A distributor feed is hours old | Labelled stale; planners warned |
| T2 Hold without owner | A hold lacks an owner | Rejected by quality rule |
| T3 Promotion on held lot | A promotion targets a held SKU | Conflict flagged to owners |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Data products with one named owner | Count in the register | Not measured |
| Products with a visible quality status | Sample | Not measured |
| Lineage chains with owners marked | Review | Not measured |
| Sensitive classes with a handling rule | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why AI needs data products | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Product register and owners | Draft register |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Quality rules and lineage | Contracts for two products |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
