> **Evidence boundary:** OmniDaily is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources contain little operating-model detail for run operations; the teams, cost drivers and ownership rules below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `CS-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Who runs intelligent operations, who owns each service, and who sees what it costs?*

**What this file shows:** a proposed team structure for OmniDaily, an ownership rule for every service in the Demo 06 landscape, a shift from ticket-based support to service ownership, and the cost drivers to make visible.

**What it does not show:** headcount, budgets, savings or any measured cost.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 51B staples group; 84,000 employees; 57 countries; 420M households served |
| Business mix | Foods 30%; beverages 23%; home care 19%; personal care 18%; wellness 10% |
| Burning platform | Demand, promotion, planning, product and ingredient data, quality and route-to-market execution fragmented across 160+ applications |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Fund a bounded demand-to-shelf and quality-evidence pilot before approving enterprise scale.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A promotion creates a shelf gap while a quality-held batch appears available in a delayed distributor feed (invented; no real safety event is claimed).

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Team structure, ownership register, cost drivers, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP tooling and licensing | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** What operating model lets OmniDaily run its landscape and AI assistants safely, with every service owned and every cost driver visible?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** ODG-P09 Elena Petrović for operations and ODG-P05 Sofia Alvarez for funding.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| ODG-P05 | Sofia Alvarez, Chief Digital and Data Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| ODG-P13 | Priya Nair, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| ODG-P12 | Omar Haddad, CISO and Privacy Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| ODG-P08 | Mei Lin, Head of Product and Ingredient Stewardship | Data and AI governance |
| ODG-P07 | David Okoro, Global Quality and Product Safety Director | Business owner (first scope) |
| ODG-P10 | Rohan Shah, Distributor and Field Execution Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| ODG-P09 | Elena Petrović, Plant Operations Director | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. From ticket support to service ownership (new design)

| Dimension | Ticket-based support | Service ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Unit of work | Ticket | Service with an owner and a runbook |
| Accountability | Queue | Named owner per service |
| Improvement | Close the ticket | Fix the cause; update the runbook |
| Automation | Ad hoc scripts | Tiered A, B or C as in Demo 06 |
| Cost view | Hours by queue | Cost drivers by service |

## 7. Proposed teams

| Team | Scope | Accountable role (proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| Quality and trace product team | Holds, trace, certificates | ODG-P07 David Okoro |
| Planning and promotion product team | Planning, promotions, availability | ODG-P10 Rohan Shah |
| Platform and Basis team | Landscape, partner interfaces | ODG-P09 Elena Petrović |
| Data and AI team | Data products, assistants | ODG-P08 Mei Lin |
| Security and partner access | Partner gateway, access | ODG-P12 Omar Haddad |

## 8. Service ownership register

Components come from the Demo 06 landscape. Named owners are assigned in the exercise; none is assumed here.

| Component | Criticality | Named owner | Runbook | On-call |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core ERP on HANA | High | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Planning and promotion application | High | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Quality system | High: holds and releases | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Distributor feed interface | High: external partners | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Manufacturing execution link | High | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Non-production systems | Low | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |

**Rhythm that constrains change (illustrative):** Promotion calendars, plant changeovers and month-end (illustrative).

## 9. FinOps: cost drivers to make visible

| Cost driver | Unit to watch | Owner (proposed) | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Partner feed volume | To be defined | ODG-P05 Sofia Alvarez | Not measured |
| HANA memory for planning | To be defined | ODG-P05 Sofia Alvarez | Not measured |
| Model calls for planning assistants | To be defined | ODG-P05 Sofia Alvarez | Not measured |
| Peak promotion capacity | To be defined | ODG-P05 Sofia Alvarez | Not measured |
| Non-production landscapes | To be defined | ODG-P05 Sofia Alvarez | Not measured |

**Rules:** every driver has an owner; assistants show cost per use; a rollout step needs a cost review. No figure is stated because none exists for this fictional case.

## 10. Skills gaps to plan for

| Skill | Why it matters | First action |
|---|---|---|
| Partner integration reliability | Needed to run the model above | Name a person and a learning plan |
| Operating AI assistants | Needed to run the model above | Name a person and a learning plan |
| Quality data engineering | Needed to run the model above | Name a person and a learning plan |

## 11. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Assign a named owner and an on-call role to each component in the register.
2. Write the first lines of a runbook for the highest-criticality component.
3. Rank the cost drivers by who can act on them and name a review date.
4. Mark which team changes are needed from today's structure.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Promotion peak | A promotion peak meets a transport | Freeze rule applies |
| T2 Partner outage | A distributor interface is down | Owner and fallback documented |
| T3 Orphan job | A planning job has no owner | Owner assigned |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Services with a named owner and on-call role | Count in the register | Not measured |
| Services with a runbook | Count | Not measured |
| Cost drivers with an owner | Count | Not measured |
| Skills gaps with a named person | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why operations fails without owners | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Teams and ownership register | Assigned owners |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Cost drivers and skills | Driver list and plan |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
