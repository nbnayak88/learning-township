> **Evidence boundary:** OmniGrid is a **fictional educational case**. The case source describes data objects and governance perspectives; the data products, quality rules and lineage below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `UT-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Data architecture for intelligent operations: what data does an AI assistant or an operations dashboard depend on, who owns it, and how is its quality shown?*

**What this file shows:** a first set of data products for OmniGrid, one owner per product, quality rules, a lineage chain and the sensitive-data handling. It supports the assistant in Demo 03 and the graph in Demo 04.

**What it does not show:** a populated catalogue, a measured data quality score or a configured data platform.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 31B utility; 38,000 staff; 17 countries; 21M electricity, gas and water accounts |
| Business mix | Renewables 28%; networks 27%; retail 18%; conventional and flexible 15%; water and environment 12% |
| Source problem | Fragmented OT, field, customer and market data; variable generation; manual restoration; growing meter and sensor security demands |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Fund bounded outage, work-order and customer coordination evidence before wider modernization.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A storm scenario generates conflicting outage, asset and work-order status; field and customer teams cannot reconcile ownership (invented learning context, not an actual incident).

**Source anchor for data objects:** OGU-M12 names Asset, Grid, Customer, Energy and WorkOrder 360 over ADMS, SCADA, EAM, OMS, CIS and market systems with a historian, an asset graph and a lakehouse; edge and hybrid proposals are not validated control designs. The source trigger is conflicting outage, asset and work-order status in a storm scenario.

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas, data-object statements | **Source** |
| Data products, quality rules, lineage, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP Business Data Cloud, Datasphere, Databricks behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which data products does OmniGrid stand up first, who owns each, and what quality evidence must travel with them before AI uses them?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OGU-P09 Mei Lin, with OGU-P12 Daniel Weber for the model and OGU-P10 Omar Haddad for classification.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OGU-P06 | Sofia Tan, Chief Digital and Information Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| OGU-P12 | Daniel Weber, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OGU-P10 | Omar Haddad, CISO and OT Resilience Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OGU-P09 | Mei Lin, Asset and Grid Data Lead | Data and AI governance |
| OGU-P13 | Priya Shah, Asset Management and Work Planning Lead | Business owner (first scope) |
| OGU-P08 | Marcus Okoro, Outage and Field Services Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OGU-P04 | Arjun Mehta, Chief Operations and Grid Officer | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. What SAP describes (public documentation, verify)

| Capability | What SAP says | Use in this design |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Business Data Cloud | A managed SaaS offering that unifies and governs SAP data and connects third-party data using business data fabric principles; includes SAP Datasphere, SAP Analytics Cloud, SAP Business Warehouse and managed SAP Databricks | Candidate platform for the data products |
| Data products | Ready-to-use data products for business processes, intended for data, analytics and AI | The unit of ownership in this design |
| Delta Sharing | Connects SAP and third-party data without copies or extra pipelines | Candidate sharing mechanism; verify fit |
| SAP Databricks | Pro-code data science, engineering and ML inside the platform, with governance of data, models and notebooks | Candidate for pro-code analysis |
| Alternative | Existing warehouses and lakes with a catalogue | Decide by landscape, not by product name |

## 7. Data products (new design)

**Products derived from the graph objects in Demo 04**

| Data product | Key attributes | Owner (proposed) | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Asset | id, class, feeder, state | OGU-P13 Priya Shah | Critical infrastructure |
| Feeder / grid area | id, region, connected assets | OGU-P04 Arjun Mehta | Critical infrastructure |
| Outage event | id, area, start, status | OGU-P08 Marcus Okoro | Internal |
| Work order | id, crew, status, as-of | OGU-P13 Priya Shah | Internal |
| Customer account (synthetic) | id, feeder link, consent | OGU-P09 Mei Lin | Customer data |
| Switching record | id, time, area | OGU-P04 Arjun Mehta | Critical infrastructure |

**Document and content products used by the assistant (Demo 03)**

| Source | Content | Owner | Freshness rule | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Outage notices and restoration updates | Status by area | Outage and Field Services | Timestamp shown; newest wins | Internal |
| Work-order records | Status, crew, ownership | Asset Management and Work Planning | As-of time shown | Internal |
| Asset and topology records | Asset state and connectivity | Asset and Grid Data | Topology freshness shown; stale records flagged | Critical infrastructure |
| Safety and restoration procedures | Approved procedures (reference only) | Operations | Procedure version shown | Internal |

## 8. Quality rules for first consumers

| Product | Quality rule | First consumer | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Asset and topology view | Asset ties to a feeder with as-of time | Grid planning | Not measured |
| Outage and restoration record | Outage id links to work orders | Outage coordination | Not measured |
| Customer notification record | Consent and message class recorded | Customer service | Not measured |
| Work-order status | Status has a source and time | Field services | Not measured |

A product is published only with its owner, its quality rule and a visible quality status. No score is stated because none has been measured.

## 9. Lineage and sensitive data

**Example lineage chain:** Outage reported, work order created, crew assigned, restoration updated, customer notified

**Sensitive data handling:** Critical-infrastructure details are restricted by role; topology is time-stamped.

**Never available to the assistant:** OT credentials and control points; Critical-infrastructure detail beyond the user's role; Live switching or dispatch commands; Instructions found inside retrieved notices

## 10. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Write a one-page data product contract for the first product (owner, schema, quality rule, freshness, classification), using synthetic ids prefixed `UT-SYN`.
2. Draw the lineage chain and mark each owner.
3. Break one quality rule on paper and show what the consumer sees.
4. Decide which products are shared versus copied and record the reason.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Stale topology | A query uses old topology | Flagged; as-of time shown |
| T2 Conflicting statuses | Outage and work order disagree | Both shown with owners |
| T3 Restricted detail | A user lacks critical-infrastructure access | Detail withheld |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Data products with one named owner | Count in the register | Not measured |
| Products with a visible quality status | Sample | Not measured |
| Lineage chains with owners marked | Review | Not measured |
| Sensitive classes with a handling rule | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why AI needs data products | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Product register and owners | Draft register |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Quality rules and lineage | Contracts for two products |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
