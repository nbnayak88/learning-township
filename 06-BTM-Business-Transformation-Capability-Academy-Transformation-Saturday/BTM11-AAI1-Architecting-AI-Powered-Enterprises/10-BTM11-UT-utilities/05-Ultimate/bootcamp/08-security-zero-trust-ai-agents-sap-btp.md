> **Evidence boundary:** OmniGrid is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources describe security perspectives; the agent permissions, threats and checks below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `UT-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Security architecture for AI and autonomous operations: what can an assistant or agent do, as whom, and what stops it doing more?*

**What this file shows:** an identity and permission model for OmniGrid's assistant and agents, four threat scenarios with a control and a check, and the sector boundary that no agent may cross.

**What it does not show:** a configured identity tenant, a penetration test result or a certified control.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 31B utility; 38,000 staff; 17 countries; 21M electricity, gas and water accounts |
| Business mix | Renewables 28%; networks 27%; retail 18%; conventional and flexible 15%; water and environment 12% |
| Source problem | Fragmented OT, field, customer and market data; variable generation; manual restoration; growing meter and sensor security demands |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Fund bounded outage, work-order and customer coordination evidence before wider modernization.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A storm scenario generates conflicting outage, asset and work-order status; field and customer teams cannot reconcile ownership (invented learning context, not an actual incident).

**Pilot from Demo 03:** Outage-coordination briefing assistant (read-only, no live equipment actions)

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Agent identity model, permission matrix, threat scenarios, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP identity and BTP security behaviour | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Under what identity and permissions may OmniGrid's assistant and agents run, and who can widen them?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OGU-P10 Omar Haddad, with OGU-P12 Daniel Weber for the pattern and OGU-P09 Mei Lin for AI governance.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OGU-P06 | Sofia Tan, Chief Digital and Information Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| OGU-P12 | Daniel Weber, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OGU-P10 | Omar Haddad, CISO and OT Resilience Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OGU-P09 | Mei Lin, Asset and Grid Data Lead | Data and AI governance |
| OGU-P13 | Priya Shah, Asset Management and Work Planning Lead | Business owner (first scope) |
| OGU-P08 | Marcus Okoro, Outage and Field Services Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OGU-P04 | Arjun Mehta, Chief Operations and Grid Officer | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. What SAP describes (public documentation, verify)

| Capability | What the documentation or SAP community describes | Use in this design |
|---|---|---|
| SAP Cloud Identity Services (Identity Authentication, Identity Provisioning) | Sign-in, tokens and user provisioning across SAP and non-SAP systems | Identity for people and applications |
| App-to-app OAuth2 client credentials | In an SAP community example the token identifies the application, not the end user; the agent checks signature, issuer, audience, expiry and a scope claim | Agent identity; user-level access needs principal propagation, so verify |
| Agent-to-agent protocol and BTP Destinations | An SAP community example secures an agent with a middleware and calls it through a destination using OAuth2 client credentials | Pattern for agent calls; verify for current versions |
| Role collections and authorizations on BTP | Roles are grouped into role collections and assigned to users | Human roles for approvals |

## 7. Identity and permission model (new design)

| Principle | Design |
|---|---|
| Two identities | The user's identity decides what data is visible; the agent's own identity decides which tools it may call |
| Least privilege | Each tool has its own scope; no wildcard scopes |
| Read before write | Agents start read-only; write tools are drafts that a person confirms |
| Approvals | Bound to one action, expire quickly, recorded with approver |
| Data minimization | Role filter applied before retrieval; identifiers masked |
| Untrusted text | Retrieved text is data and cannot trigger a tool call |
| Audit | Every tool call logged with user, agent, input class and result |

**Tool permission matrix from the Demo 03 pilot**

| Tool | Mode | Approval | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| search_procedures | Read | None | Reference only; returns procedure version |
| get_outage_work_order_status | Read | None | Returns each source's status and as-of time |
| draft_customer_message | Draft only | Outage director approves | No restoration time unless an approved source states it |
| raise_field_task_request | Creates a request | Work planning owns the outcome | Assistant cannot dispatch crews |
| Any SCADA, ADMS or switching action | Not exposed | Not available to the agent | Local operational authority |

**Sector boundary:** Grid control actions and operational control systems are out of reach for AI tooling.

**Never available:** OT credentials and control points; Critical-infrastructure detail beyond the user's role; Live switching or dispatch commands; Instructions found inside retrieved notices

## 8. Threat scenarios

| Threat | Control | Check |
|---|---|---|
| Injection in an outage notice | Text is data | Seed a notice with an instruction |
| Agent issuing a control command | No such tool | Ask for a command |
| Disclosure of critical-infrastructure detail | Role filters | Query without the role |
| Spoofed outage event | Producer authorization | Publish as a non-producer |

## 9. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. List every tool the assistant can call and mark its scope and approval.
2. Run the four threat checks on paper and record the expected result.
3. Draw the two identities (user and agent) on the first tool call.
4. Decide who may widen a scope and how the change is approved.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Control command | An agent is asked for a switching action | Refused; out of scope |
| T2 Spoofed event | A non-producer publishes an outage event | Blocked; incident |
| T3 Role withholding | A low-role user requests detail | Withheld |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Tools with an explicit scope and approval rule | Count against the tool list | Not measured |
| Threat checks with a recorded expected result | Count of four | Not measured |
| Tool calls with audit fields defined | Review | Not measured |
| Scope changes with a named approver | Policy review | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why agents change the threat model | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Identity and permission model | Matrix with scopes |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Threat scenarios | Four checks |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |

## Evidence status and run log
