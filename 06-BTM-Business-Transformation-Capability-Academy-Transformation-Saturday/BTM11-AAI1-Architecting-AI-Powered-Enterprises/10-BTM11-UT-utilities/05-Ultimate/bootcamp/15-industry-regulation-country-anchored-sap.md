> **Evidence boundary:** OmniGrid is an **aspirational case study**. The case sources name headquarters countries but almost no regulations; this file points to regimes to verify and does not state legal conclusions. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `UT-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Which regulatory regimes touch the architecture, in the countries this case names, and what evidence would each need?*

**What this file shows:** the countries the case names, the regimes to verify for each, which design element each regime touches, and the evidence slot each would need.

**What it does not show:** legal advice, a compliance assessment or a claim that any regime is met. Every instrument is a pointer to verify with counsel.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 31B utility; 38,000 staff; 17 countries; 21M electricity, gas and water accounts |
| Business mix | Renewables 28%; networks 27%; retail 18%; conventional and flexible 15%; water and environment 12% |
| Source problem | Fragmented OT, field, customer and market data; variable generation; manual restoration; growing meter and sensor security demands |

**Countries named by the case:** Copenhagen (Denmark) and Sydney (Australia), per the case profile.

**Country rule for this series:** only countries named in the case are used. No other country is assumed.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A storm scenario generates conflicting outage, asset and work-order status; field and customer teams cannot reconcile ownership (invented learning context, not an actual incident).

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, headquarters countries | **Source** |
| Regime pointers, design touchpoints, evidence slots, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| Legal status of any instrument | Public sources reviewed 2026-11-10 for two items only (see section 6); everything else is **verify with counsel** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which regimes does OmniGrid treat as design constraints from the start, who confirms them, and where does the evidence live?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OGU-P10 Omar Haddad and OGU-P09 Mei Lin, with legal counsel confirming each regime. Counsel is not a persona in the case and is shown here as an external role.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OGU-P06 | Sofia Tan, Chief Digital and Information Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| OGU-P12 | Daniel Weber, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OGU-P10 | Omar Haddad, CISO and OT Resilience Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OGU-P09 | Mei Lin, Asset and Grid Data Lead | Data and AI governance |
| OGU-P13 | Priya Shah, Asset Management and Work Planning Lead | Business owner (first scope) |
| OGU-P08 | Marcus Okoro, Outage and Field Services Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OGU-P04 | Arjun Mehta, Chief Operations and Grid Officer | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. Regimes to verify

| Area | Instrument or authority to verify | Touches this design | Evidence slot |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personal data (Denmark, EU) | General Data Protection Regulation and the Danish data protection act (verify) | Customer and workforce data | Records of processing, rights process |
| Cybersecurity (Denmark, EU) | NIS2 Directive and its Danish implementation (verify status) | Enterprise security and incident reporting | Risk measures and incident path |
| AI (EU) | EU AI Act; see section 6 for the dates reported | Assistants in Demo 03 | Use-case class and documentation |
| Critical infrastructure (Australia) | Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 and related obligations (verify applicability to each asset class) | Outage and work systems, boundary to control systems | Boundary diagram, risk programme evidence |
| Personal data (Australia) | Privacy Act 1988 (verify current amendments) | Customer data | Data map and rights process |

**EU AI Act timing reported by a law-firm summary (verify the final text).** A provisional political agreement of 6 May 2026 (the 'digital omnibus') reportedly moves high-risk obligations for stand-alone systems from 2 August 2026 to 2 December 2027, and for AI in regulated products to 2 August 2028; transparency obligations otherwise stay on schedule for 2 August 2026. The summary said new dates take legal effect only on publication of the amending act, so confirm that it has been published.

## 7. Design questions every regime raises

| Question | Design element | Owner (proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| Where does each data set live and who may move it? | Data products and residency rules (Demo 07) | OGU-P09 Mei Lin |
| What must be reported, to whom, and how fast? | Incident path (Demos 06 and 12) | OGU-P10 Omar Haddad |
| Which AI uses fall under a rule? | Use-case class and change control (Demo 09) | OGU-P09 Mei Lin |
| Which third parties are involved? | Dependency register (Demo 12) | OGU-P12 Daniel Weber |
| What evidence will an authority ask for? | Evidence slots in each demo | OGU-P04 Arjun Mehta |

**Cross-border flows:** the case names more than one country, so every flow between them needs a recorded basis and an owner. Do not assume one country's rule covers another.

## 8. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. List the data flows between the named countries (synthetic) and mark the owner of each.
2. For two regimes, write the evidence slot and who supplies it.
3. Walk the first tabletop test and mark who is told and in what order.
4. Mark every statement in the file that still needs counsel to confirm.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Two-regime incident | An incident touches Danish and Australian services | Both reporting paths and one owner |
| T2 Control boundary | An assistant is asked for a control action | Refused; boundary evidence |
| T3 Residency | Customer data moves between regions | Transfer basis and residency recorded |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Regimes with an owner and an evidence slot | Count | Not measured |
| Cross-border flows with a recorded basis | Count | Not measured |
| Statements confirmed by counsel | Count of confirmed items | Not measured |
| Incident paths per named country | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this aspirational case study. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why regulation shapes architecture | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Countries and regime pointers | Verified list with gaps marked |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Cross-border flows and evidence | Flow table and slots |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
