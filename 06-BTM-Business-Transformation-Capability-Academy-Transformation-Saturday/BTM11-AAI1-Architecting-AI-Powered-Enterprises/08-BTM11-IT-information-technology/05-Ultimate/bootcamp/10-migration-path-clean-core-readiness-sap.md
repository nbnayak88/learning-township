> **Evidence boundary:** OmniTech is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources describe a target and a trigger but no current SAP estate; the options, waves and readiness questions below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `IT-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *How does an enterprise get from its current landscape to a clean-core, event-aware, AI-ready architecture without stopping the business?*

**What this file shows:** the path options, a sequence of waves for OmniTech, the custom-code questions to ask before any wave, readiness gates and a rule for exceptions.

**What it does not show:** an inventory of a real estate, a migration estimate or a go-live plan. No durations or costs are stated.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 39B technology provider; 98,000 employees; 41 countries; 11,500 clients |
| Business mix | Cloud and platform 31%; software 25%; cyber 18%; AI and data 16%; managed services 10% |
| Source problem | Fragmented lifecycle tooling, bespoke integrations, poor data and AI reuse, late security and observability |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Fund a bounded platform-to-client-outcome pilot with security, recovery and economic evidence before wider rollout.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A client disputes an on-time delivery milestone; teams cannot reconcile release, incident and customer-success records (invented discovery context).

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas, capabilities and value streams | **Source** |
| Path leaning, waves, readiness gates, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP migration tooling and programmes | Public SAP documentation not reviewed in depth for this demo; **verify before use** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** Which path and which first wave does OmniTech choose, and what must be true before each wave starts?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OTS-P04 Arjun Mehta, with OTS-P12 Daniel Weber for architecture and OTS-P13 Priya Shah for operational readiness.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OTS-P04 | Arjun Mehta, Chief Technology Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| OTS-P12 | Daniel Weber, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OTS-P10 | Omar Haddad, CISO and Supply-Chain Security Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OTS-P09 | Mei Lin, Data Governance and Knowledge Lead | Data and AI governance |
| OTS-P05 | Elena Fischer, Chief Customer Success Officer | Business owner (first scope) |
| OTS-P08 | Marcus Okoro, SRE and Managed Services Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OTS-P13 | Priya Shah, DevSecOps and Release Director | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. Path options (new design, generic)

| Option | Idea | Favoured when | Main risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Greenfield | Start a new system and move selected data | The current estate is hard to fix and the business can accept redesign | Loss of useful history; long parallel running |
| Brownfield (system conversion) | Convert the existing system in place | Processes are stable and custom code can be remediated | Carries old customisation forward |
| Selective or bluefield | Move chosen processes or data, redesign others | Some areas need change and others do not | Needs clear scope rules and data ownership |
| Side-by-side first | Build new capability on BTP and leave the core alone | The business need is new and the core is stable | Integration sprawl without the admission rule |

**Leaning for this case:** Per-system choice; delivery pipeline and ITSM first because disputes start there. This is a hypothesis for discovery, not a recommendation.

## 7. Waves (new design)

| Wave | Scope |
|---|---|
| Wave 1 | release and incident evidence |
| Wave 2 | customer-success milestones |
| Wave 3 | remaining processes |

**Wave entry gates:** inventory complete for the wave; owners named; Clean Core admission rule applied to every extension; rollback path written; freeze calendar checked; evidence slots for tests prepared.

## 8. Custom code and extension readiness

| Question | Why it matters | Evidence needed | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Which custom objects touch this wave? | Hidden dependencies stop a wave | Usage and owner for each | Not collected |
| Which are still used? | Unused code is retired, not migrated | Usage evidence | Not collected |
| Which extensions fit the Clean Core levels? | Decides migrate, rebuild or retire (Demo 02) | Level assessment | Not collected |
| Which interfaces must stay unchanged? | Protects partners and operations | Interface list with owners | Not collected |

**Sector readiness questions:**

- Which pipelines cannot pause?
- Which tenants have contract limits?
- Which custom ITSM code exists?
- What are customer milestone dates?

## 9. Exceptions

An exception to a gate needs a named approver, an expiry date, a rollback plan and a note in the decision record. Exceptions that repeat become a design review item.

## 10. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. List ten synthetic custom objects (prefix `IT-SYN`) and place each in migrate, rebuild or retire with a reason.
2. Order the three waves and write the entry gate for the first.
3. Mark the freeze calendar and test the first wave date against it.
4. Write one exception and its expiry.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Milestone clash | A wave meets a milestone | Calendar rule |
| T2 ITSM custom code | Custom code in ITSM | Admission rule |
| T3 Tenant limit | A change breaches a tenant limit | Tenant owner approves |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Waves with all entry gates met on paper | Review of the gate list | Not measured |
| Custom objects with owner and usage evidence | Count against the inventory | Not measured |
| Exceptions with approver and expiry | Count | Not measured |
| Rollback paths written per wave | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Path options and why not one answer | Shared options |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Waves and gates | Wave plan without dates |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Custom code triage | Ten objects placed |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |

## Evidence status and run log
