> **Evidence boundary:** OmniTech is a **fictional educational case**. The case sources contain little operating-model detail for run operations; the teams, cost drivers and ownership rules below are new design. Nothing here is a record of a client implementation, an executed test or a realized benefit. Names marked synthetic carry the prefix `IT-SYN` and are new design. SAP product statements come from public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10 and must be verified before real delivery.

## 1. The question this file answers

> *Who runs intelligent operations, who owns each service, and who sees what it costs?*

**What this file shows:** a proposed team structure for OmniTech, an ownership rule for every service in the Demo 06 landscape, a shift from ticket-based support to service ownership, and the cost drivers to make visible.

**What it does not show:** headcount, budgets, savings or any measured cost.

## 2. Case anchor (source facts)

| Attribute | Case baseline |
|---|---|
| Scale | USD 39B technology provider; 98,000 employees; 41 countries; 11,500 clients |
| Business mix | Cloud and platform 31%; software 25%; cyber 18%; AI and data 16%; managed services 10% |
| Source problem | Fragmented lifecycle tooling, bespoke integrations, poor data and AI reuse, late security and observability |

**Decision under discussion (source):** Fund a bounded platform-to-client-outcome pilot with security, recovery and economic evidence before wider rollout.

**Illustrative trigger (source):** A client disputes an on-time delivery milestone; teams cannot reconcile release, incident and customer-success records (invented discovery context).

## 3. Source versus new design

| Element | Status |
|---|---|
| Case facts, personas | **Source** |
| Team structure, ownership register, cost drivers, tests | **New design (illustrative)** |
| SAP tooling and licensing | Public SAP documentation reviewed 2026-11-10; **not exercised here** |

## 4. Decision under discussion

**Decision:** What operating model lets OmniTech run its landscape and AI assistants safely, with every service owned and every cost driver visible?

**Accountable owner (proposed):** OTS-P13 Priya Shah for operations and OTS-P04 Arjun Mehta for funding.

## 5. Personas and proposed decision rights

| Source ID | Persona | Proposed role in this demo |
|---|---|---|
| OTS-P04 | Arjun Mehta, Chief Technology Officer | Funds and prioritizes |
| OTS-P12 | Daniel Weber, Director Enterprise Architecture | Owns standards and review |
| OTS-P10 | Omar Haddad, CISO and Supply-Chain Security Lead | Security and boundary approval |
| OTS-P09 | Mei Lin, Data Governance and Knowledge Lead | Data and AI governance |
| OTS-P05 | Elena Fischer, Chief Customer Success Officer | Business owner (first scope) |
| OTS-P08 | Marcus Okoro, SRE and Managed Services Director | Business owner (second scope) |
| OTS-P13 | Priya Shah, DevSecOps and Release Director | Operational authority and veto |

Decision rights are **proposed** and need discovery validation.

## 6. From ticket support to service ownership (new design)

| Dimension | Ticket-based support | Service ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Unit of work | Ticket | Service with an owner and a runbook |
| Accountability | Queue | Named owner per service |
| Improvement | Close the ticket | Fix the cause; update the runbook |
| Automation | Ad hoc scripts | Tiered A, B or C as in Demo 06 |
| Cost view | Hours by queue | Cost drivers by service |

## 7. Proposed teams

| Team | Scope | Accountable role (proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery platform product team | Pipeline, releases | OTS-P05 Elena Fischer |
| SRE and service operations | Incidents, error budgets | OTS-P13 Priya Shah |
| Customer success product team | Milestones, evidence | OTS-P08 Marcus Okoro |
| Data and AI team | Data products, assistants | OTS-P09 Mei Lin |
| Security operations | Tenant isolation, access | OTS-P10 Omar Haddad |

## 8. Service ownership register

Components come from the Demo 06 landscape. Named owners are assigned in the exercise; none is assumed here.

| Component | Criticality | Named owner | Runbook | On-call |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Delivery pipeline | High | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| ITSM | High | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Customer-success application | Medium | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Core ERP on HANA | High | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Observability stack | High | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |
| Non-production systems | Low | To be assigned | Not written | To be assigned |

**Rhythm that constrains change (illustrative):** Release trains and customer milestone dates (illustrative).

## 9. FinOps: cost drivers to make visible

| Cost driver | Unit to watch | Owner (proposed) | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Observability data volume | To be defined | OTS-P04 Arjun Mehta | Not measured |
| Per-tenant compute | To be defined | OTS-P04 Arjun Mehta | Not measured |
| Model calls for assistants | To be defined | OTS-P04 Arjun Mehta | Not measured |
| Pipeline run time | To be defined | OTS-P04 Arjun Mehta | Not measured |
| Non-production environments | To be defined | OTS-P04 Arjun Mehta | Not measured |

**Rules:** every driver has an owner; assistants show cost per use; a rollout step needs a cost review. No figure is stated because none exists for this fictional case.

## 10. Skills gaps to plan for

| Skill | Why it matters | First action |
|---|---|---|
| Error budget practice | Needed to run the model above | Name a person and a learning plan |
| Operating AI assistants | Needed to run the model above | Name a person and a learning plan |
| Tenant-aware cost attribution | Needed to run the model above | Name a person and a learning plan |

## 11. Hands-on exercise (synthetic data)

1. Assign a named owner and an on-call role to each component in the register.
2. Write the first lines of a runbook for the highest-criticality component.
3. Rank the cost drivers by who can act on them and name a review date.
4. Mark which team changes are needed from today's structure.
5. Record open decisions in the run log.

## Three tabletop tests

A tabletop test is a paper walk-through, not a technical test of a running system.

| Test | Setup | Expected finding |
|---|---|---|
| T1 Error budget burn | Burn rises before a milestone | Release slowdown decision by named owner |
| T2 Tenant cost | One tenant drives cost | Attribution visible; owner reviews |
| T3 On-call gap | No on-call for a service | Service not promoted to production |

## Acceptance (measures only; no baselines or targets asserted)

| Measure | How it is observed | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Services with a named owner and on-call role | Count in the register | Not measured |
| Services with a runbook | Count | Not measured |
| Cost drivers with an owner | Count | Not measured |
| Skills gaps with a named person | Count | Not measured |

No baseline, target or benefit is stated because none exists for this fictional case. Targets are agreed in discovery.

## 2–3 hour session pattern

| Time | Activity | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0:00 to 0:20 | Why operations fails without owners | Shared problem statement |
| 0:20 to 1:00 | Teams and ownership register | Assigned owners |
| 1:00 to 1:45 | Cost drivers and skills | Driver list and plan |
| 1:45 to 2:15 | Tabletop tests | Three findings |
| 2:15 to 2:30 | Decisions | Open items with owners |
